# Remote Executable Control for Windows and Linux

This Python script (`launcher.py`) provides a simple solution for remotely starting and stopping executable (.exe) files on both Windows and Linux systems. It's designed to be versatile and easy to use, particularly for managing game servers, Discord bots, and other applications run through executable files (.exe or .bat).

## Usage

1. **Configuration**: Edit the `launcher.py` script to specify the paths of the executable files you want to control. You can add or remove paths directly in the script.

2. **Running the Script**: Run the `launcher.py` script on your Windows or Linux server. It will automatically start the executable files specified in the script.

# WHY THE NEED

It's a great idea if you want users to share one VPS and not have to create a lot of accounts on the VPS. Then, you have to  lock down every permission to prevent them from affecting other users' servers, power, and other things.



## Customization

Feel free to customize the `launcher.py` script according to your needs. You can add error handling, logging, or additional features as required.
